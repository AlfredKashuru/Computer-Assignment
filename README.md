So will  go through the 5 stages of project management  if you feel this tough you can use the same process on a portfolio project. 

Methodology: Use the five stages of project management to guide your work.

Stages:

Initiation:
Define the project scope, objectives, and deliverables. Identify stakeholders and team members.
Planning: 
Break down the project into tasks, estimate timelines, assign resources, and establish a budget. Choose tools and techniques for tracking progress.
Execution:
Implement the plan, manage tasks, monitor progress, communicate with stakeholders, and address any challenges.
Monitoring and Control: 
Track progress against the plan, adapt to any changes and ensure the project stays on track.
Closure:
Evaluate the project's success, document lessons learned, and celebrate the achievement.
Flexibility: 
If this feels overwhelming, you can also use this project as a portfolio piece for different programs, adapting the deliverables and timelines as needed.

Additional Notes:

Consider specifying the nature of the project (e.g., research, community service, design, etc.) for better understanding.
If using the same project for different programs, clearly differentiate the specific deliverables and completion dates for each.
